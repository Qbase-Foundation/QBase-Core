Building Qbase Core

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/Qbase-Foundation/QBase-Core/releases

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building qbased,
